      <p><i>The four inner planets consist mainly of heavy elements, have few moons, and lack rings.
        They are largely composed of refractory minerals such as silicates that form their mantle and crust, and metals (such as iron and nickel) that form their core.
        The three inner planets—Venus, Earth, and Mars—have atmospheres; all have impact craters, surface tectonic features (such as rift depressions), and volcanoes.</i></p>

      <div class="alert alert-light">
      <p><i><u>The closest planet to the Sun in the Solar System.
        It revolves around the Sun in 87.969 Earth days. It belongs to the inner planets because its orbit lies closer to the Sun than the asteroid belt.
        After depriving Pluto of its planet status, It is the smallest planet in the Solar System.</u></i></p>

        <p><i><u>It has an extremely rarefied atmosphere. It consists of atoms "knocked out" from the surface of the planet by the solar wind.
          It's large iron core and thin crust have yet to be properly explained.
          There is a hypothesis that suggests that the outer layers of the planet, composed of light elements, were torn off by a giant collision, which reduced the size of the planet and also prevented the complete absorption of it by the young Sun.</u></i></p>

      <p><i><u> it has a thick atmosphere and a thick silicate shell around an iron core.
        On the surface of planet there are bright signs of former geological activity, primarily volcanism.
        There is almost no water in plenet.
        It is the hottest planet: its surface temperature exceeds 400 °C.
        The reason for this is the greenhouse effect in a dense atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide.
        No reliable signs of modern endogenous geological activity have been found on planet,
        but since it has no magnetic field to prevent the depletion of its existing atmosphere,
        it suggests that its atmosphere is regularly replenished by volcanic eruptions.
        Planet has no natural satellites.</u></i></p>

        There are volcanoes on its surface, the largest of which, Olympus, exceeds all terrestrial volcanoes in size,
        reaching a height of 21.2 km. Rift depressions (Mariner valleys) testify to former tectonic activity.
        Modern tectonic and volcanic activity on planet is not registered, but, according to some estimates,
        Olympus last erupted no more than 2 million years ago.
        The red color of the surface of planet is due to the large amount of iron oxide in its soil.
        The planet has two satellites - Phobos and Deimos. It is assumed that they are captured asteroids.</u></i></p>
